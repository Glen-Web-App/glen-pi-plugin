description: Turn what you just did (or a markdown prompt the user provides) into a reusable skill — either a local SKILL.md on this machine or a shared Glen skill saved to the org's library. Use when the user says "make this a skill", "save this as a skill", "save this as a Glen skill", or wants to capture a repeatable workflow.

You are authoring a reusable **skill** — a focused markdown prompt another agent will follow later, with no memory of this session.

1. **Pick the destination FIRST — local file or Glen skill.** A skill is either a **local `SKILL.md`** on this machine (a Pi skill, visible only to you) or a **Glen skill** saved to your Glen library (recorded; private to you by default, sharable with teammates or the whole org).
   - **Check incognito before anything else:** run `glen status` via Bash. If it reports `incognito: ON`, a Glen skill is off the table — nothing is recorded off the record — so go straight to a **local skill** and tell the user that's why (e.g. "you're off the record, so I'll save this as a local skill").
   - **Otherwise, ask the user which they want** before authoring anything: a local `SKILL.md` (a Pi skill on this machine) or a Glen skill (saved to your Glen library). Don't start writing until they answer.
2. **Gather the real workflow.** Read this conversation for the steps that actually worked. For anything done in an earlier session, run `glen search "<topic>"` via Bash to pull the relevant memory. Ask one or two clarifying questions only if the goal or trigger is genuinely ambiguous.
3. **Name + describe it.** A short imperative name and a one-sentence description that says *exactly when to trigger it* (this drives discovery).
4. **Write a tight SKILL.md body.** Best practices:
   - Lead with *when to use it* and the end goal.
   - Give concrete, ordered steps — exact commands, file paths, gotchas — not vague advice.
   - Keep it self-contained: assume zero prior context. Cut anything that isn't actionable.
   - **Reference other skills** when a step is itself a saved skill: write a markdown link `[Display text](glen:<slug>)` (find the slug with `glen skill search`). Glen tracks the link automatically and the reader will get a runnable `glen skill use <slug>` command exactly there — keep each referenced skill focused and say *when* to reach for it. Reserve this for genuinely **shared** skills — ones that also get used on their own, independent of this one.
   - **If the skill needs supporting material, bundle it in one skill directory, not separate subskills.** Put long reference material in `references/*.md` and executable helpers in `scripts/` alongside `SKILL.md`, and point to them from the body as `${GLEN_SKILL_DIR}/references/<name>.md` / `${GLEN_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/<name>` — `glen skill use` materializes the whole directory to disk and substitutes `${GLEN_SKILL_DIR}` with its real absolute path before printing, so the reader can run the script or open the reference exactly as written. This keeps one topic as one skill instead of splintering it into a root + subskills just to hold its own files.
5. **Finish based on the destination chosen in step 1:**

   **Local skill** (and always the incognito path) — nothing leaves the machine:
   - Save it to `.pi/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in this project — or `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for a personal skill that follows you across every project.
   - Start the file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, and the `description` from step 3), then the body.
   - No `glen skill create`, no recording. Confirm the saved path to the user.

   **Glen skill** (only when not incognito):
   - **Declare its dependencies.** List the external tools/runtimes/MCPs the skill needs (node, an MCP, a CLI, …). For each: run `glen dependency search "<tool>"` via Bash — if a confident match exists, note its `[id]`; otherwise web-search the canonical source/install page and note `{ name, description, sourceUrl, kind }` (kind = mcp|cli|runtime|library|service). Write them to a JSON array file, e.g. `/tmp/glen-deps.json`, mixing `{ "dependencyId": "<id>" }` (reuse) and new objects.
   - **Save it** via Bash. Text-only skill (no `references/`/`scripts/`): write the body to a file (e.g. `/tmp/glen-skill.md`), then run (add `--deps /tmp/glen-deps.json` if there are any):

     ```
     glen skill create --name "<name>" --description "<one-line>" --file /tmp/glen-skill.md --deps /tmp/glen-deps.json
     ```

     Skill with bundled files: build the package in a temp directory first — `SKILL.md` at its root, plus whichever of `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` it needs (only those three subdirs are uploaded; caps are 100 files, 1MB per text file, 2MB per binary file, 3MB total) — then run:

     ```
     glen skill create --name "<name>" --description "<one-line>" --dir /tmp/glen-skill-pkg --deps /tmp/glen-deps.json
     ```

     `--file` and `--dir` are mutually exclusive. On a name collision either form errors — pick a different name and retry, or pass `--update` to overwrite a skill you previously authored.
   - The skill is **private to the user by default**. Ask the user whether to share it: with the whole org (add `--org` to `glen skill create`, or later `glen skill share <slug> --org`) or with specific teammates (`glen skill share <slug> --with <email>[,<email>…]`). Confirm the saved slug and its visibility back to the user.
